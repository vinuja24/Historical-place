        The Great Wall of China is one of the greatest sights
         in the world  the longest wall in the world, an 
         awe-inspiring feat of ancient defensive architecture. 
         Its winding path over a rugged country and steep mountains
          take in some great scenery.<br><br>
        <b><i>History of the Great Wall of China</i></b><br><br>
        The Great Wall of China has a history of more than 
        2,300 years. The Great Wall of Chinas history began 
        in the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) and was 
        last rebuilt as a defense in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).<br><br>
    <b>Early Walls (770-221 BC)</b><br><br>
    During the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) and the
     Warring States Period (475-221 BC) when the eastern 
     and central region of what is now China consisted of
      many small states or princedoms, the princes ordered
       independent walls be built along state borders to protect
        their states. The earliest was probably built between the 
        states of Lu and Qi around 650 BC, which later became part
         of the Chu State Wall.<br><br>
        <b>The Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC)</b><br><br>
        Qin Shihuang (king of the State of Qin from 247-221 BC)
         conquered and unified the other states.
          Emperor Qin Shihuang ordered that the northern sections
           of walls on state borders, especially the walls in the
            northern part of China built by the states of Qin, 
            Zhao, and Yan, be joined together to form a unified 
            line of defense against Mongol harassment from the 
            north, the first true Great Wall. Other state border
             walls became obsolete in a unified China and were 
             subsequently eroded or dismantled.<br><br>
            <b>The Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD)</b><br><br>
            The northern fortifications were strengthened and 
            lengthened, with sections of wall running parallel 
            for hundreds of kilometers and interlinking along 
            the Inner Mongolian border.<br> 

            The Han Dynasty Great Wall from the North Korean coast
             near Pyongyang in the east to Jade Gate Pass 
             (Yumenguan) in the west was the longest the
              Great Wall has ever been at more than 8,000 km 
              (5,000 miles). The total length included many 
              branching walls, natural barriers, and trenches.<br><br>
              <b>The Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)</b><br><br>
              The Yuan Dynasty was the first dynasty in which 
              the whole of China was controlled by a non-Han
               people, the Mongols. The Great Wall had done a 
               good job of preserving Han China for 1,500 years.
                The building of the Great Wall, not surprisingly,
                
                ceased during the Yuan Dynasty, as China and 
                Mongolia to the north were one.<br><br>
                <b>The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)</b><br><br>
                China flourished during the Ming Dynasty and 
                its military might swelled. The Great Wall was
                 systematically rebuilt in a 100-year project to 
                 prevent further northern invasion.

Most of the remaining Great Wall was built in the Ming Dynasty
 and is known as the Ming Great Wall. The Great Wall sections
  close to Beijing like the Badaling section and Mutianyu section 
  were built during the Ming Dynasty.<br><br>
  <b>Post-Ming History (1644-present)</b><br><br>
  A breach in the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644 by Manchu 
  forces signaled the end of Han control in China for the last
   and final Chinese dynasty, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). 
   It also signaled the end of construction and maintenance of
    the Great Wall, until the Badaling section was restored by 
    the government of the Peoples' Republic of China, and opened 
    to the public in 1957 as a tourist attraction.<br><br>
