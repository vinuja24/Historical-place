        Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italian Torre Pendente di Pisa,
         medieval structure in Pisa, Italy, that is famous for
          the settling of its foundations, which caused it to 
          lean 5.5 degrees (about 15 feet [4.5 metres]) from the 
          perpendicular in the late 20th century. Extensive work
           was subsequently done to straighten the tower, and its 
           lean was ultimately reduced to less than 4.0 degrees.<br><br>
           Construction of the tower began in 1173, but after work
            had progressed to the second floor in 1178, it was 
            already starting to sink. Shortly after, the Republic 
            of Pisa was busy battling the likes of Genoa, Lucca and 
            Florence, so construction ceased. Some experts now 
            believe that without this pause, which allowed the soil
             to settle, the tower would have almost certainly toppled 
             over.<br><br>
             When builders eventually finished the third floor, 
             the tower tipped 0.2 degrees northwest. As efforts were
              made to correct the tilt, and as the structure grew in 
              height, the tower ended up leaning one degree to the 
              south.<br><br>

             The construction of the tower continued, as did its 
             tilt. Engineers tried to counteract the lean by making
              the upper floors taller on one side, but the additional 
              weight only caused the foundations to sink further. 
              With the addition of a bell-chamber in 1372, the 
              structure was finally completed.<br><br>
             
             To correct the lean and reduce the risk of collapse, 
             engineers tried a number of tricks, including adding 
             lead counterweights to the base and putting scaffolding 
             on the towerâ€™s weakest parts. By the 1990s though, the 
             tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.<br><br>
